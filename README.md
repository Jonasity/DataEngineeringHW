# Data Engineering HW OUTDATED
My first solution to the Vinted Engineering Academy Data Engineering homework   

This is a python project, python must be installed with a compatible IDE.
Developed and tested using Visual Studio Code  

>Download the files into an empty folder. Open the folder in an IDE (such as Visual Studio).   
In the terminal, run with:
python test.py   
Running this command will call the functions with the necessary inputs to complete tasks 1 and 2   

The MapReduce framework is located, fittingly, in the MapReduceFramework.py file.  
The solution is not hardcoded, so any csv files where the purpose is to count occurence of unique values would find success in this framework. 
A quick and dirty solution incase I did not finish a more sophisticated one.
